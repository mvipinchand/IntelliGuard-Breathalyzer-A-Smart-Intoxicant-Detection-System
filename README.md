# Smart-Breathalyzer
 A transformative Smart Breathalyzer system designed to redefine responsible drinking practices and enhance road safety. Utilizing an MQ3 alcohol sensor, the system accurately finds intoxication levels in individuals. Upon detecting intoxication, an integrated camera captures the vehicle's number plate (tesseract), sends it to a centralized Google Sheets (via Google Cloud Console) triggering a comprehensive database search (Atlas â€“ MongoDB) for the driver's details, including name, phone number, and license number. <br />

This information is then used to penalize the intoxicated individual for potential drink and drive offenses. The system automates the penalty process and issues notifications via email (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - SMTP) to the offender, ensuring effective intervention. Our project encompasses the development, integration, and evaluation of this innovative system, presenting a novel approach to discourage drunk driving and promote a safer community. <br />
The captured frame is converted to grayscale and then subjected to bilateral filtering and edge detection (Canny) to enhance the license plate's visibility. Contours are detected in the processed image, and the largest contour, assumed to be the license plate, is identified. In order to identify the outline of the image, namely to detect the edge of the image, the relevant differential operator will be used.[3] The script then creates a mask based on the detected contour and applies it to the original image to isolate the license plate. The isolated license plate region is then cropped and saved as a separate image.
Tesseract OCR is applied to the cropped license plate image to extract the alphanumeric characters. Tesseract is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, however, due to limited resources only Windows and Ubuntu are rigorously tested by developers.
